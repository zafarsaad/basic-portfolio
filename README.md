A barebones portfolio.

I wanted to put something up as fast as possible to start showcasing some of the recent projects I'm working on. I've marked my calendar to update and enhance the design and force myself to stick to HTML, CSS and vanilla JS because most of the work I do uses Angular/React/Vue for the frontend.
